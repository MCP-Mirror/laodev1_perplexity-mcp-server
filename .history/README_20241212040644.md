# Perplexity MCP Server

## Overview

The Perplexity MCP Server is a specialized implementation of Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables secure, two-way connections between Perplexity AI's language models and various data sources. This server acts as a bridge between Perplexity's AI capabilities and your local or remote resources, allowing for context-aware AI interactions while maintaining security and privacy.

## Key Features

  - Full support for MCP client-server architecture
  - Secure two-way connections between Perplexity AI and data sources
  - Resource and tool capability exposure through standardized interfaces

- **Perplexity AI Integration**
  - Seamless integration with Perplexity's models via their API
  - Support for context-aware completions
  - Enhanced responses through local and remote data source access

- **Resource Management**
  - Local file system access
  - Database connections (PostgreSQL, etc.)
  - API integrations
  - Custom tool definitions

- **Security**
  - Built-in security controls for resource access
  - Clear system boundaries
  - No sharing of API keys with LLM providers
  - Enterprise-grade authentication support
